# boardingProject
A simulating and visualizing software for airplane boarding.

The Aircraft Boarding Visualizer (ABV) was developed as an undergraduate final year project at the University of Glasgow in 2015/16. The aim of the project was to develop an opensource software which could visualize the different boarding methods which can be used to enplane an aircraft.

## Known Issues
As of August 2016, there are still a few bugs which causes the boarding process to enter into a deadlock when using the Back-to-Front, Innovative, and Random methods. You are more then welcome to attempt resolve these issues.
